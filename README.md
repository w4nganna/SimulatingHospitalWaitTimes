# SimulatingHospitalWaitTimes

This project employed Simio to simulate hospital wait times as patients moved through treatment wards and rehabilitation before discharge. The simulation helped identify system bottlenecks, which were subsequently adjusted to minimize delays. Although this assignment was completed for a class and will not be posted publicly, it provided an excellent opportunity to familiarize myself with Simio.

Using provided data, python was utilized to fit distributions to patient arrival times and rehabilitation durations, which then served as inputs for our Simio model. I was fortunate to lead the development of the Simio model, deepening my understanding of simulation techniques and system optimization.
